This package provides a code-folding mechanism based on tree-sitter
package.  Turn on the minor-mode `treesit-fold-mode' to enable
this mechanism.  Note that all functionalities provided here based on the
`tree-sitter-mode', and thus it should be enabled before
`treesit-fold-mode' can properly fold codes.
