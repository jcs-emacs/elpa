outli-mode is a simple minor-mode on top of outline-minor-mode
which supports configurable special comment lines as level-aware
outline headings which can be collapsed, navigated, moved, etc.
outli styles headings for easy level recognition and provides a
org-mode-like header navigation and editing capabilities, including
speed keys activated at the start of headings.

Customize `outli-heading-config' to set the "stem" and "repeat"
character for comment-based headings and to influence how the
headings are styled.  Customize `outli-speed-commands' to alter or
disable speed keys, which work at the beginning of heading lines
only.
