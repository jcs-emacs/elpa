;;; Commentary:

;; Simple company-mode completion backend for windows batch/dos scripting modes.
;; Offers completion for 80-90 basic commands returned by 'help'.

;; Usage:
;;
;; Add to a suitable location on the `load-path' and either require or autoload
;; `company-cmd'.
;;
;; See: [cmd-mode](http://github.com/nverno/cmd-mode) for combining with
;; completion-at-point (not provided in base `bat-mode').
