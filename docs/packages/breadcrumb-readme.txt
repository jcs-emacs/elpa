;; Usage:
;
; Breadcrumbs are sequences of short strings indicating where you
; are in some big tree-like maze.
;
; To craft these strings, this library uses the maps provided by
; project.el and Imenu, respectively.  Project breadcrumbs shows you
; the current buffer's path in a large project.  Imenu breadcrumbs
; show the current position of point in the buffer's nested
; structure of programming constructs (for example, a specific
; functions within multiple C++ nested namespaces).
