## üèÜ Goals

- Use built-in code over third-party library (`dash.el`, `s.el`, `f.el`, etc)
- Reuse third-party libraries if possible to keep the maintenance (think of the entire ELPA is a one huge piece of software), but not required
- Accept any packages, but they need to show some usefulness
- Don't remake the wheel, try to search for existing packages before you create one
- Contribute to existing packages that have similar features (unless the author refuses)
- Keep up the package's maintenance if possible, and ask someone for help if you need to

## üî® How to use?

Add the following to your configuration:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '( "jcs-elpa" . "https://jcs-emacs.github.io/jcs-elpa/packages/") t)
```

Use priority if you don't want this archive overridden with other larger archives:

```elisp
(setq package-archive-priorities '(("melpa"    . 5)
                                   ("jcs-elpa" . 0)))
```
