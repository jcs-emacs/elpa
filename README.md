# jcs-elpa
> ELPA for [jcs-emacs](https://github.com/jcs-emacs/jcs-emacs), using [github-elpa](https://github.com/10sr/github-elpa)

## üèÜ Goals

- Prioritize using built-in code over third-party libraries (e.g., dash.el, s.el, f.el).
- Reuse third-party libraries when possible to reduce maintenance (consider ELPA as a single large project), but it's not strictly necessary.
- Accept package contributions, but they must demonstrate clear usefulness.
- Avoid reinventing the wheel‚Äîsearch for existing packages before developing a new one.
- Contribute to existing packages with similar functionality, unless the author declines contributions.
- Maintain your packages as much as you can, and ask for help if needed.

## üî® How to use?

Add the following to your configuration:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '( "jcs-elpa" . "https://jcs-emacs.github.io/jcs-elpa/packages/") t)
```

Use priority if you don't want this archive overridden with other larger archives:

```elisp
(setq package-archive-priorities '(("melpa"    . 5)
                                   ("jcs-elpa" . 0)))
```
